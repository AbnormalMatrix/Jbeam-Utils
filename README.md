# JBeam-Utils
A set of tools designed to help create vehicles with accurate physics in BeamNG.drive. Currently a work in progress, not ready for use yet.

## Installing
Installing this project currently requires [Rust's cargo tool-chain](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and should work on both Windows and Linux.

 1. `git clone https://github.com/Skierman/Jbeam-Utils`
 2. `cd Jbeam-Utils`
 3. `cargo run --release`

## Usage
The UI has not been my top priority with this project. Press the help button to see some basic instructions on how to use the program. Currently the only way to load 3D models by putting an OBJ in the assets folder called model.obj. I would like to improve this soon. If you are exporting from Blender you may need to change your model orientation for it to work correctly.

## TODO:
 - [ ] add the ability to select beams without having to manually select individual nodes
 - [ ] fix jbeam parser
	 - [ ] parse engines
- [ ] Fix material editor
- [ ] GUI to load models
- [ ] Remove unused code
## Screenshots
Note: These screenshots are from older versions of the program. Changes to things may have been made.
